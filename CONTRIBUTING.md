Napchart-website is a website that uses the napchart library to draw the canvas. Anything related to the canvas can be found in [github.com/larskarbo/napchart](https://github.com/larskarbo/napchart/)

The napchart website consists of:

* **Back-end** - written in node.js. Uses mongodb to store charts. Located in `/server`
* **Front-end** - written in react. Uses ES6 with *webpack* as a package manager. Source lives in `/client`, and finished compiling is in `/dist`
* **Napchart library** - used by both the *back-end* and the *front-end*. This is a seperate project and can be found at [github.com/larskarbo/napchart](https://github.com/larskarbo/napchart/)

## Front-end

### Structure

```
client
	├── components
	    └── App.jsx 	# Base component that gathers all others
	    └── ... 
	├── styles			# Sass styling code
	├── index.html		# Basic html-file that is moved to dist when compiling
	├── index.jsx		# Main point for the javascript code
	└── server.js		# Helper file for communicating with server
dist
	├── corejs.js		# Polyfill file generated by webpack
	└── index_bundle.js	# Our super javascript file generated by webpack
```

### React

This project uses react, but I have probably broken a few rules and not followed all best-practices. In an earlier version of napchart, it used react + redux and everything was nice and good BUT it was big codebase and the verbosity killed me. I had to write so much code to do so little and often had to do similar things both in this repo and in the `napchart` canvas repo.

Now most data is stored in the `chart` object created in the `Chart.jsx` component. This way, you can use functions like `updateElement` and `isSelected` right from that object. It makes it really easy and efficient to work with.
